
Hey buddy. Now I have this request. Can you assist?
"Write a SQL query to retrieve sales revenue and quantity contributions by customer, calculated as a percentage of total sales revenue and quantity for each quarter and year"
The query is written in sql server.

Sure, I'd be happy to help you out. Let's assume you have a table named "sales" with the following structure:

customer_id: The ID of the customer
sale_date: The date of the sale
quantity: The quantity sold
revenue: The revenue from the sale
We'll calculate the total sales revenue and quantity for each quarter and year, then determine each customer's contribution to those totals.

Here is the SQL query:

sql
Copy code
WITH quarterly_sales AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id, 
        DATEPART(YEAR, sale_date) AS sale_year,
        DATEPART(QUARTER, sale_date) AS sale_quarter,
        SUM(quantity) AS customer_quantity,
        SUM(revenue) AS customer_revenue
    FROM 
        sales
    GROUP BY 
        customer_id, 
        DATEPART(YEAR, sale_date), 
        DATEPART(QUARTER, sale_date)
),
total_quarterly_sales AS (
    SELECT 
        sale_year,
        sale_quarter,
        SUM(customer_quantity) AS total_quantity,
        SUM(customer_revenue) AS total_revenue
    FROM 
        quarterly_sales
    GROUP BY 
        sale_year, 
        sale_quarter
)
SELECT 
    qs.customer_id, 
    qs.sale_year, 
    qs.sale_quarter, 
    qs.customer_quantity,
    qs.customer_revenue,
    (qs.customer_quantity / NULLIF(tqs.total_quantity, 0)) * 100 AS quantity_contribution_pct,
    (qs.customer_revenue / NULLIF(tqs.total_revenue, 0)) * 100 AS revenue_contribution_pct
FROM 
    quarterly_sales qs
JOIN 
    total_quarterly_sales tqs ON qs.sale_year = tqs.sale_year AND qs.sale_quarter = tqs.sale_quarter;
This query will provide the customer_id, sale year, sale quarter, the customer's quantity sold and revenue generated during that period, and the customer's contribution as a percentage of total quantity and total revenue for the same period.

The NULLIF function is used to prevent division by zero errors, if there are any quarters with no sales at all.
